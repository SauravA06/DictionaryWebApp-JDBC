**Project Title: Dictionary Web Application**

**Description:**
The Dictionary Web Application is a comprehensive online tool designed to manage and explore a dynamic dictionary database. This application allows users to seamlessly add, remove, and search for words, providing an efficient and user-friendly experience. The project is hosted on GitHub and utilizes Java technologies for the backend, JSP for the frontend, and Oracle as the database.

**Key Features:**

1. **User-friendly Interface:**
   - The application offers an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface implemented using JavaServer Pages (JSP). Users can effortlessly interact with the dictionary database.

2. **Word Management:**
   - Users can add new words to the dictionary, providing definitions, examples, and other relevant information. The system ensures data integrity by validating and storing entries securely in the Oracle database.

   - The application also supports the removal of words, allowing users to maintain an up-to-date and relevant dictionary.

3. **Search Functionality:**
   - A robust search feature enables users to quickly find words and their corresponding definitions. The search algorithm efficiently queries the Oracle database, delivering accurate and prompt results.

4. **Backend Technology:**
   - The backend of the application is developed using Java Servlets, ensuring a robust and scalable architecture. Servlets handle user requests, process data, and interact with the Oracle database to retrieve and update dictionary information.

5. **Database Integration:**
   - Oracle is employed as the backend database management system. It stores and manages the dictionary data, ensuring data consistency, reliability, and security. The application establishes a seamless connection to Oracle for efficient data retrieval and storage.

6. **GitHub Repository:**
   - The entire project is hosted on GitHub, providing a collaborative platform for developers. The repository includes the source code, documentation, and any additional resources required for the project.

**Technologies Used:**
- Frontend: JavaServer Pages (JSP)
- Backend: Java Servlets
- Database: Oracle
